There are 3 product groups and 16 product types in total. Please divide them into 16 "Product.json", 
each named using the first letter of the product group and the first two letters of the product type.
For example, for "Wall tiles - Bathroom," the name should be "Product_wba.json."

Within the 16 product types, there will be 6 products each. Therefore, 
ensure the Product names are correctly structured for accurate JSON readability.

Thank you.
